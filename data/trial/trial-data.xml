  <instance id="0" scenario="making a camping trip">
    <text>Camping is one of my favorite summer vacations . There are several camp grounds I like to go to , so I make sure to call ahead and reserve a campsite . Once I have a site reserved , I make my camping gear list . I need to make sure I have all the things I will need to be comfortable , like a tent to sleep in , and a sleeping bag to sleep in . And of course I 'll need to eat , so I 'll need a kerosene stove and a grill for the fire . I will also bring a camp chair so I can sit comfortably around the campfire . Along with my camping gear I 'll need to bring clothes , like hiking shoes , a bathing suit for swimming and warm clothes for the chilly nights . Once I have all my gear and clothing I 'll pack it into my car , making sure to leave room for myself , my dog and anything my friends want to bring . And then we are ready for our camping vacation .</text>

  <instance id="1" scenario="cooking pasta">
    <text>When I cooked pasta last , I had a great experience . I was with my girlfriend and we were in the mood for pasta and meat sauce . In order to do this , we first picked the pasta out of the cabinet and opened up the box . As we put the pasta in , we stirred it and watched the water boil . After putting in spices and watching the pasta for about five to ten minutes , we tried one piece of pasta to see if it was soft enough to eat . Upon trying the food and enjoying the taste , we put the meat sauce on the pasta and let it get hot . Upon both the pasta and the sauce getting hot , we put it all on bowls and ate the pasta .</text>

  <instance id="2" scenario="making a shopping list">
    <text>I need to go grocery shopping this weekend so I am in the process of making a shopping list . I 'll look through my fridge , freezer and cabinets to see what I am low on and need to restock that I use regularly ; coffee , stevia , mint tea bags , paper towels . I 'll also check to see if I need anything like shampoo or deodorant . When I get the grocery store ads and coupons in the mail I will look through to see what is on sale or what I have a coupon for and I will plan my meals based on what I can get at a good price . I will then make my list organized according to what I can get at what store . I do the majority of my shopping at one store so that will be the big chunk of the list but there are some things that I have to go to other stores for , I will put that on the other side of the paper . Once I have my list made , I 'll double check it and head out to go shopping .</text>
